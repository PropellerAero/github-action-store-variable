# Releases versioning
We follow Semantic Versioning. (`major.minor.patch`)

Our versioning process is completely automated, any changes landing on the `main` branch will trigger a new [release](https://github.com/UnlyEd/github-action-await-vercel/releases).

- `MAJOR`: Behavioral change of the existing API that would result in a breaking change.
  - E.g: Removing an input, or changing the output would result in a breaking change and thus would be released as a new MAJOR version.
- `Minor`: Behavioral change of the existing API that would **not** result in a breaking change.
  - E.g: Adding an optional input would result in a non-breaking change and thus would be released as a new Minor version.
- `Patch`: Any other change.
  - E.g: Documentation, tests, refactoring, bug fix, etc.

## Releases versions:
- We do not provide major versions that are automatically updated (e.g: `v1`).
- We only provide tags/releases that are not meant to be changed once released (e.g: `v1.1.0`).

> As utility, we provide a special [`latest`](https://github.com/UnlyEd/github-action-await-vercel/releases/tag/latest) tag which is automatically updated to the latest release.
> _This tag/release is **not meant to be used in production systems**, as it is not reliable (might jump to the newest MAJOR version at any time)._
